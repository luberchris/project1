Home cooks and meal planners

Problem:
Recipes online are unorganized
Generating shopping lists takes up time
Removing unnecessary information / ads

Primary goal:
Streamline the meal-planning and shopping process


Wireframe ideas:

Left column has a menu with three hyperlink tabs - Home, my recipes, and my shopping list

    -Home tab take the user to a  homepage with search bar. Seatch queries will populate 10 results with small images and a name of recipe. Upon clicking the items, more infomration on that recipe will be displayed, including a larger image, and the ingredients required. Users will then be able to "heart" the recipe, which will add it to their "my recipes".

    - The My Recipes tab will take us to a page with a list of all of the user's favorited recipes, displayed the same as in the search results, on click will give them more information. In place of the "heart" option to favorite a recipe, will be an "x" option to remove it from their favorites.

    - The shopping list tab will have list ingredents from all of the recipes that the user has saved to "my recipes". Maybe it should have an on click button to generate a printer friendly shopping list? 

Top right - set up login button in top right of web page that will prompt user to create an account with email verification.
